I led the migration of a video archiving platform from Symfony 3 to Symfony 6.4, ensuring compliance with modern standards and optimizing performance through advanced caching features. Responsibilities included auditing the existing architecture, updating dependencies, and implementing improvements to deliver a scalable and efficient solution.
